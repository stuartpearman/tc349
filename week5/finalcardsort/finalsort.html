		<h2>My sorting process</h2>
		<p>
			Faced with the task of creating the foundation for my final web page, I had limitless freedom to make whatever I wanted. At the same time I had way too many ideas to make a well organized site. I eventually just started putting my ideas on index cards.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to make a big blog, showcasing my skills as a front end developer, with interactive graphics, and intuitive navigation. Grouping the cards together helped me formulate an idea of what I wanted the site to be, and seeing my friends' input helped show me what I could do differently.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started out with the idea of a portfolio, showcasing my web and graphic design skills. so I grouped together my contact info, samples of my work, and a link to my resume. My portfolio is still small, so I knew just a portfolio would not be enough to make a complete site.
		</p>
		<p>
			From there I envisioned a front cover page - type of thing. With an interactive graphic, and a short "About Me" bio describing myself and the site. I wanted somewhere in the page to include a really bad quote, something no one would care about, as I'm always quoting the least memorable lines from movies. I thought the first page may be a good place for this.
		<p>
		<p>
			As with any good blog, I would want some kind of feed, with the date and a heading. I grouped this with "Cool Articles", because I figured it would integrate nicely into the blog.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really wanted to include a Spotify feed of some sort, showing what I've been listening to. Twitter feeds are basically mandatory with blogs these days. I also wanted a link to Facebook, Github and Twitter.
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought it would be cool to keep everyone updated on what I'm doing. I included a section where you can see what I've been watching on Netflix, what game i'm playing, the things I'm learning about, and what I really want to spend my money on. I envisioned this in a big footer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally I wanted to have a couple fun blurbs on a fake cat named Backwards Greg my friends and I like to put in random places to annoy each other. As I huge coffee fan, I wanted to have a little blurb about coffee as well, but that may not make the final cut.
		</p>
		<h2>Additional Trials</h2>
		<p>
			I asked three of my friends, Colton, Kate, and Nathan, to arrange the cards in whatever order made sense to them, and this is what they came up with:
